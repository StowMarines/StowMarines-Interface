PLEASE ONLY USE THE SOFTWARE HERE IF YOU ARE AN ALPHA OR BETA TESTER. I CANNOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN THOSE LISTED BELOW.

## About
The StowMarines Interface is a replacement for Arma3Sync specifically designed and coded for the StowMarines. It is planned to extend it's features to host elements such as (and not limited to): a unit calendar, staff dashboard, LOA system etc.

## Download

## Info
Currently, it is missing some features and there are improvements that need to be made, however it is in a realitively stable state.

If you use Avast, it will scan it the first time you launch it, after that it should cause no issues.

Feel free to stress test it a fair bit, but remember that I'm mainly looking for bugs at the moment, so if you open ten versions of it and it causes you problems, that's a no brainer.
