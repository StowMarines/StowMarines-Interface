# StowMarines_Interface

The StowMarines Interface is now at a usable state. It is missing lots of features and there are some improvements that need to be made, but it should be usable at the moment.

To help with tracking, each version that I will send through, has a version title in the top left hand corner of the interface. 

At the moment, I'm just worried about bugs/issues/problems, then I will move onto crucial recommendations then optional recommendations afterwards.

To see the development tracker that I keep up to date, visit this: https://trello.com/b/Y1lchBxd/stowmarines-interface

To report a bug/issue/problem you've found, please create a GitHub Issue in this repo: https://github.com/StowMarines/StowMarines_Interface/issues

My avast scans SM Interface each time I boot it, but then states that there are no issues with it. If you use Avast and it keeps scanning, you can add an exception if you are happy to (I have done this for myself and has caused no issues).

Current Version for testing is version 1.0.1 Alpha.

Feel free to stress test it a fair bit, but remember that I'm mainly looking for bugs at the moment, so if you open ten versions of it and it causes you problems, that's a no brainer at the moment.
