# StowMarines_Interface

## About
The StowMarines Interface is a replacement for Arma3Sync specifically designed and coded for the StowMarines. It is planned to extend it's features to host elements such as (and not limited to): a unit calendar, staff dashboard, LOA system etc.

## Download

## Info
Currently, it is missing some features and there are improvements that need to be made, however it is in a realitively stable state. 

At the moment, I am only accepting GitHub issues regarding bugs/issues/problems & crucial recommendations. Non-crucial reccomendations will be accepted once the program is near completetion for it's initial phase.

When you download the file, you will get a blue window appear. Press 'Run Anyway'. If this option is not visible, press the 'MoreInfo' button: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68105236/119230888-0efbf500-bb16-11eb-8fd3-cf72949fc116.png)

If you use Avast, it will scan it the first time you launch it, after that it should cause no issues.

Feel free to stress test it a fair bit, but remember that I'm mainly looking for bugs at the moment, so if you open ten versions of it and it causes you problems, that's a no brainer.
